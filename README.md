#Front End Developer Exercise

How good is your front end code? The following exercise will help us to assess your coding skills.

* Please code up to the best of your ability, the included [PSD](https://github.com/JustGiving/Recruitment-Test-Front-End-FETeam/raw/ef8ed663ec93f8b5d46f7e80a721782ac0377ae2/visual-test.psd) or [jpg](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/JustGiving/Recruitment-Test-Front-End-FETeam/ef8ed663ec93f8b5d46f7e80a721782ac0377ae2/visual-test-flat.jpg). There is one page to create.  Build everything you see. Use what you know to build the best quality page you can!
* Create a working form that allows you to add new events and display it in the sidebar. Use an appropriate MV* framework to do this and be prepared to justify your choices. 
* Please keep in mind we will be looking at all aspects of your end delivery, so don’t hold back anything. We are particularly interested in how you approach the exercise and understanding why you chose to do things a certain way. 
* Feel free to ask us any questions that you would normally ask your Product Manager, UX Designer or Visual Designer before you start the exercise. 
* Build your components assuming that this is a deliverable for a larger web application, so consider scalability, portability, extensibility.
* Explain/document your coding decisions.
* Use HTML, CSS and JavaScript best practices.
* The pages should work in:  IE8, IE9, IE10, FireFox (latest version), Safari ( latest version) and chrome (latest version).
* Consider all copy on the page (including those that appear to be images) may be localized into one of 20 languages and the copy  may need to change in the future based on the needs of the business
* Please take performance into consideration.
* Do not use any CSS frameworks.
* Send us a Dropbox/Skydrive/whatever link to your zipped code to sonal.patel@justgiving.com but please do not send attached zip files via email.
